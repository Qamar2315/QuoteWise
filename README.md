## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18.x or later recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js)
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) instance (local or cloud-based like MongoDB Atlas)
-   A **Google Gemini API Key**. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Qamar2315/QuoteWise.git
    cd QuoteWise
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the server directory
    cd server

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Create a .env file in the /server directory
    touch .env
    ```
    Add the following environment variables to your `.env` file:
    ```env
    # The port your server will run on
    PORT=8080

    # Your MongoDB connection string
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/quotewise_database

    # Your Google Gemini API Key
    GEN_API="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```

3.  **Set up the Frontend Client:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the client directory from the root
    cd client

    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    ```
    The client is configured to connect to the backend running on `http://localhost:8080`. If your server is running elsewhere, modify the `apiUrl` in `client/environment.dev.ts`.

### Running the Application

You need to run both the server and the client in separate terminal windows.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    # In the /server directory
    npm start
    ```
    The server should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Client:**
    ```bash
    # In the /client directory
    npm run dev
    ```
    The Angular application will be accessible at `http://localhost:4000`.
